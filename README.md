  ## Description:
  This is a little proyect I did to be able to extract text from images using Python libraries and Javascript functions to get the values from the HTML.

  ## Dependencies:
  For Python: Eel, importlib.resources, pathlib, os, PIL, pytesseract.

  ## Usage:
  This project uses the Python Eel library to communicate between Python and Javascript. You just need to put the images in the web/img folder and open them with the program from there.
